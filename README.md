### I've recently graduated from the SchoolofCode and I'm now looking for my first career in the tech sector where I can continue to build on the skills I learnt in their intensive sixteen-week boot camp.

I love solving problems with code and so far have an equal love of either working on the front-end with React building SPAs or the backend with Node.js. Most importantly I enjoy breaking down the problems and solving them with logic and code!

Before deciding to change careers I used to manage the motorway network from a control room and the skills you need to thrive in that team environment is something I'm carrying with me now I'm working with code instead.

When I'm not working on something code-related or spending time with my family I'm a keen gamer and I'm looking forward to building things related to my hobby.
